Go and Talk page builder is a lightweight web design tool running in the browser. It empowers designers and marketers to create presentable pages quickly without coding. It is tailored for running on mobile devices such as tablets. The generated web pages are responsive, lightweight and optimized for search engines.

Go and Talk page builder uses Tachyons CSS to achieve flexible and modular designs. The utility classes take effect only when applied to an element. The element styles are reset to default when the classes are removed. This approach helps to keep the CSS slim even for complicated projects. Designers can style an element freely without worrying about breaking something else.

Go and Talk page builder supports inline style declaration and external CSS files. The inline styles written in the site settings window take effect immediately, and are saved automatically. Professional designers may find this feature useful in creating custom animations as you can watch the animation taking place while you change the parameters. When you are happy about the result, the parameters are already included in the site setting ready for production.

The external CSS URLs can load custom CSS files, external CSS library, or custom fonts such as Google fonts.
