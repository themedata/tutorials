Go and Talk is a lightweight web design tool running in the browser. It empowers designers and marketers to create presentable pages quickly without coding. It is optimized for mobile devices.

Global data is shared by pages of the same project. Each page can have its look and feel, with the same data, such as menu items.

Global section is a section with complete data and settings, such as a site wide call to action section. It can be inserted anywhere on a page, and rendered with the same data. This feature can be used to keep a bunch of commonly used blocks as global, and inserted on demand when you create new pages.  Just be aware it is global. If you update it on one page, the changes will apply to all pages with the same global section.

If you have completed all the exercises in this tutorial, you should have made the following achievements:

* know where to find section toolbar and global toolbar.
* understand the global data and global section.
* make use of global sections to create a new page quickly.

Well done. You will acquire new skills and explore new features in other tutorials. Stay tuned.
