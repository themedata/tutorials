Go and Talk page builder is a lightweight web design tool running in the browser. It empowers designers and marketers to create presentable pages quickly without coding. It is tailored for running on mobile devices such as tablets. The generated web pages are responsive, lightweight and optimized for search engines.

Go and Talk page builder uses a template engine called doT to render sections upon page loading, and to export a webpage when done. Custom delimiters and variables are used for doT to generate a slim web page without the burden of editor.

Go and Talk page builder supports custom export template for designers and developers to load libraries selectively, or to customize meta tags and scripts on the exported webpage. This allows designers and developers to customize everything in the final output.
