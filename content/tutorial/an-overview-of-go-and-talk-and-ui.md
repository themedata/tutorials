Go and Talk page builder is a lightweight web design tool running in the browser. It empowers designers and marketers to create presentable pages quickly without coding. It is tailored for running on mobile devices such as tablets. The generated web pages are responsive, slim, and optimized for search engines.

Go and Talk page builder starts to run when you browse a tutorial page. It looks for site id and document id from the navigation address, and uses the default ids if you are browsing a page for the first time. It then looks for data in your browser and display the page using your data. If no data is found, it displays the default content.

You can load a public page from remote storage and make changes to the pages freely while you follow a tutorial. You can find the original content of the tutorial in Talks section.

Go and Talk page builder is capable to  manage multiple sites or projects, and create multiple pages. The step to step guides are in other tutorials.

Each section on this page is an app. You can browse the page as normal, or edit the content by toggling on an app and switching to editing mode. Your data stays in your browser while you editing a page.

When you are ready to publish, you can export a page without editor. It is slimmer and loads faster.

This page gives an overview of the editor toolbars and how it works in general. If you are new to web publishing, you may follow the steps in [Building a Marketing Website From A to Z ](/tutorial/building-a-marketing-website-from-a-to-z) to build your first website quickly.
